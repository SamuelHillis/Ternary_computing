# Ternary Computer Design

This is my general attempt at designing a ternary computer. Most of this work 
was done while super hyper focused over the spring break of 2021 and I'm backing
it up to be safe.

## 1. TODO
Read up on:
* How to create a proper instruction set
* What parts are 

Circuit Design
* Additional ALU operations
* Registers
* Control Unit

Instructions:
* Design machine code
* Decide whether to port over existing instruction set or create something new


## 2. Type of Ternary
I am planning on using Balanced over Base 3 for the following reasons:
* I think Balanced is cool
* It seems more common in relevant articles
* Removes the need for any sort of carry trit


## 3. ALU
Currently supported operations:
* Adding
* Subtracting
* Comparing
